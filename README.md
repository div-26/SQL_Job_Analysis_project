## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing job posting data related to **Data Analyst roles**.  
By using **SQL (PostgreSQL)** as the primary tool for querying and data exploration, the project aims to uncover trends in salaries, hiring companies, job locations, and the skills most in demand.  
The purpose of this analysis is to translate raw job data into valuable insights that reflect the current state of the Data Analytics job market.  
It serves as both a learning exercise in SQL and a practical exploration of how structured query language can reveal patterns in real-world employment data.

## Background

The dataset used in this project comes from the [SQL Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA)

It includes multiple dimensions such as:
- **Company details** – information about the employer and hiring organization  
- **Job titles and roles** – description and categorization of each position  
- **Location types** – remote, hybrid, and on-site job opportunities  
- **Salary information** – annual average salary data where available  
- **Posting details** – job posting date, schedule type, and other attributes  

The goal of analyzing this dataset is to understand the **factors that influence salaries, hiring patterns, and demand for analytical skills**.  
This project reflects how data-driven insights can help professionals and students identify valuable trends in the growing Data Analytics job market.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my
SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data
analysts?
4. Which
skills are associated with higher
salaries?
5. What
are the most optimal skills to learn?

## Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** – used for executing SQL queries, data exploration, and analysis  
- **Visual Studio Code** – the main editor for writing and managing SQL scripts  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control, tracking changes, and sharing the project  
- **Excel / CSV Files** – used as data sources imported into PostgreSQL for analysis  

These tools together provided a complete workflow for performing data analysis — from raw data extraction to structured insights and documentation.
